### 3. **Routes**

```

## Customer Table Structure

The customer table has the following structure:

id              bigint(20) unsigned  auto_increment primary key
name            varchar(255)         nullable
email           varchar(255)         unique not null
country_id      bigint(20) unsigned  nullable
password        varchar(255)         not null
remember_token  varchar(100)         nullable
status          varchar(255)         not null default 'Active'
created_at      timestamp            nullable
updated_at      timestamp            nullable
deleted_at      timestamp            nullable (soft deletes)
```

## Key Differences from User Management

| Feature | Users | Customers |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Purpose | Admin/Staff accounts | End-user accounts |
| Fields | Role-based access | Status-based access |
| Deletion | Hard delete | Soft delete with restore |
| Country | Multiple address fields | Single country_id |
| Status | Boolean active/inactive | String Active/Inactive/Suspended |

## Security Features

1. **Authentication**: Admin login required
2. **Authorization**: Admin role required
3. **Validation**: Server-side form validation
4. **CSRF Protection**: All forms protected
5. **Password Hashing**: Bcrypt encryption
6. **Soft Deletes**: Data recovery possible

## Technical Implementation

### Controller Methods
- `index()` - List customers with search/filter
- `create()` - Show create form
- `store()` - Save new customer
- `show()` - Display customer details
- `edit()` - Show edit form
- `update()` - Update customer
- `destroy()` - Soft delete customer
- `restore()` - Restore deleted customer
- `forceDelete()` - Permanently delete
- `changeStatus()` - AJAX status update

### Validation Rules
```php
'name' => 'nullable|string|max:255'
'email' => 'required|string|email|max:255|unique:customers'
'password' => 'required|string|min:6|confirmed' (create)
'password' => 'nullable|string|min:6|confirmed' (update)
'country_id' => 'nullable|integer'
'status' => 'required|string|in:Active,Inactive,Suspended'
```

### AJAX Features
- Real-time status updates
- No page refresh required
- Success/error notifications

## Testing

The system includes:
- Unit tests for Customer model
- Factory for generating test data
- Seeder for sample customers

Run tests:
```bash
php artisan test --filter=CustomerTest
```

Generate sample data:
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=CustomerSeeder
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. **Country Management**: Create countries table and relationship
2. **Customer Authentication**: Separate customer login system
3. **Customer Dashboard**: Frontend customer portal
4. **Email Notifications**: Account status change notifications
5. **Export/Import**: CSV/Excel customer data management
6. **Advanced Filtering**: Date ranges, bulk operations
7. **Customer Groups**: Categorize customers
8. **Activity Logs**: Track customer account changes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Route not found**: Clear route cache with `php artisan route:clear`
2. **View not found**: Check view file paths and names
3. **Permission denied**: Ensure user has admin role
4. **Database errors**: Run migrations with `php artisan migrate`

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check routes
php artisan route:list --name=admin.customer_management

# Clear caches
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan view:clear
php artisan route:clear

# Check database
php artisan tinker
>>> App\Models\Customer::count()
```
